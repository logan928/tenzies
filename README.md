# 🎲 Tenzies Game - React App

Welcome to **Tenzies**, an addictive mini dice game built with **React**, **JSX**, and **CSS**! This project showcases my front-end development skills using **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`) while delivering an engaging and interactive user experience.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. On load, ten dice are rendered with random values.
2. Players click on dice to **hold** their values.
3. Clicking "Roll" re-randomizes only the **non-held** dice.
4. The game checks: if all dice are held and have the same value, the player wins!
