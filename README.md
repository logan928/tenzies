# 🎲 Tenzies Game - React App

Welcome to **Tenzies**, a fast-paced, addictive dice game built with **React**, **JSX**, and **CSS**! This project showcases my front-end development skills using **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`) while delivering an engaging and interactive user experience.

## 💡 What Is Tenzies?

Tenzies is a classic dice game where the objective is to **roll until all ten dice show the same number**.

- 🎯 You can **hold** dice at any time to preserve their values.
- 🎲 The rest of the dice will roll when you click "Roll".
- 🧠 Use strategy: hold the numbers you’re targeting and roll the rest!
- 🏆 Win when all ten dice show the same value **and** are held.

It’s easy to learn, tricky to master—and a great way to show off interactive UI logic in React.

- 🎯 Real-time game logic using `useState` and `useEffect`

## 🧪 How It Works

1. On load, ten dice are rendered with random values.
2. Players click on dice to **hold** their values.
3. Clicking "Roll" re-randomizes only the **non-held** dice.
4. The game checks: if all dice are held and have the same value, the player wins!
